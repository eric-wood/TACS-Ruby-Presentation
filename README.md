# Ruby - Derailed
### By Eric Wood

The purpose of this presentation is to teach the audience a thing or two about Ruby...without Rails being involved.

I've been asked in the past if Ruby existed outside of the Rails world (legitimate questions), so this presentation seeks to answer with an emphatic *YES*!

Ruby is fun. Enjoy the silly example code provided here.
